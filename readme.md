# Neon Void

"Neon Void" is a cyberpunk-ish, neon-soaked image board with upload and comment functionality. Done in Vue.js in a week during my stint at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/). Vue.js was the first framework used during the course. _Note: I've decided on not hosting this project, due to liablity concerns._
